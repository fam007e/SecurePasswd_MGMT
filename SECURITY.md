    tcgetattr(STDIN_FILENO, &term);
    term.c_lflag &= ~ECHO;          // Disable echo
    tcsetattr(STDIN_FILENO, TCSANOW, &term);
}

void show_input(void) {
    struct termios term;
    tcgetattr(STDIN_FILENO, &term);
    term.c_lflag |= ECHO;           // Re-enable echo
    tcsetattr(STDIN_FILENO, TCSANOW, &term);
}
```

**Security Benefits:**
- Prevents shoulder surfing attacks
- No password echoing to terminal
- Secure restoration of terminal state
- Protection against terminal history logging

## 📁 File System Security

    struct stat st = {0};
    
    if (stat("data", &st) == -1) {
        if (mkdir("data", 0700) != 0) {  // Owner: rwx, Group: ---, Others: ---
            printf("Error: Cannot create data directory\n");
            exit(1);
        }
    }
}
```

### 📊 File Security Matrix

| File | Permissions | Content | Protection Level |
|------|------------|---------|------------------|

| `master.key` | `0600` (rw-------) | PBKDF2 hash + salt | High |
| `passwords.dat` | `0600` (rw-------) | AES-256 encrypted data | Maximum |
| `totp.dat` | `0600` (rw-------) | AES-256 encrypted secrets | Maximum |

### 🏗️ File Structure Security
```
data/                           # 0700 permissions
├── master.key                  # Format: "hash salt\n"
├── passwords.dat              # Encrypted password entries  
└── totp.dat                   # Encrypted TOTP secrets
```

**Security Features:**
- **Atomic Operations:** File operations are atomic when possible
- **No Temporary Files:** All operations in-memory to prevent data leaks
- **Local Storage Only:** No network operations or cloud synchronization
- **Access Control:** Unix file permissions restrict access to owner only

## 🔑 Authentication

### 🔐 Master Password Requirements

The master password system implements multiple security layers:

```c
// Authentication flow from main.c
int validate_master_password(const char *input_password) {
    FILE *file = fopen("data/master.key", "r");
    if (!file) {
        // First-time setup
        return setup_master_password(input_password);
    }
    
    char stored_hash[65], salt[33];
    fscanf(file, "%64s %32s", stored_hash, salt);
    fclose(file);
    
    // Generate hash from input with stored salt
    char input_hash[65];
    generate_password_hash(input_password, salt, input_hash);
    
    // Secure comparison
    return (strcmp(stored_hash, input_hash) == 0);
}
```

### 🔄 Authentication Flow

1. **First-Time Setup:**
   - Check if `data/master.key` exists
   - If not: Enter setup mode
   - Generate cryptographically secure 16-byte salt
   - Apply PBKDF2-SHA256 with 10,000 iterations
   - Store hash and salt securely

2. **Subsequent Authentication:**
   - Load stored hash and salt from `master.key`
   - Apply same PBKDF2 process to input password
   - Perform constant-time comparison of hashes
   - Grant or deny access based on result

3. **Security Properties:**
   - **No Password Storage:** Only hash stored, never plaintext
   - **Salt Protection:** Each installation has unique salt
   - **Timing Attack Resistance:** Constant-time comparison
   - **Brute Force Resistance:** 10,000 iterations significantly slow attacks
